# SpringCourse
Files for the [SpringFrameworkGuru Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-6-beginner-to-guru) I'm doing.

This course uses Spring Framework 6 with Spring Boot. It's being done from a domain-driven perspective starting out with the Entities, Author and Book. 
We're using an H2 in-memory database, so data does not persist across re-starts, which is what you want for a learning exercise to a great degree. 
We then create the repository interfaces for the entities & set up the many to many relationship between them.

I'll keep updating this README as I do more, so as to give a pr√©cis of the course, what I'm doing & what order it's happening in. 
For me personally these are all things I've done at various times as a back end developer but since I work mainly in app support on the same app for years, 
it tends to be that I do the thing once, get it sorted & then only look at it again if there's a bug - or someone else might do it, 
& if there's a bug I'll get to mess with it. This is sub-optimal for learning to the extent that you internalise & commit to memory the things learned. 
You end up having to look up everything again, and that can restrict your ability to get through technical interviews. The things you have to do repeatedly 
when you burn out a dozen or so CRUD systems a week are the things you have to do maybe once in 3 years if you're maintaining those systems once the developer 
who created it has ridden off into the sunset cackling "So long, suckas!"
